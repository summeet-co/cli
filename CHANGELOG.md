# Changelog

All notable changes to chatwoot-cli are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Global `search` command across conversations, contacts, messages, and help-center articles, with `--only` to restrict the output to a single bucket.
- Date-range filtering for `search` via `--after`/`--before`/`--on` (and `--tz` for bare dates); the server applies the window when the account has the `advanced_search` feature enabled.

### Changed

### Fixed

## [0.6.1] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- Release workflow wrote the extracted release notes into the working tree, leaving git dirty and causing GoReleaser to abort with a "dirty state" error. The notes are now written to the runner temp directory, and `release_notes.md` is gitignored as a safety net for local dry runs.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- Help center commands for managing portals and articles ([#15](https://github.com/chatwoot/cli/pull/15)).

### Changed

- Reworked the authentication flow ([#19](https://github.com/chatwoot/cli/pull/19)).
- Updated bundled usage examples.
- Bumped `github.com/getkin/kin-openapi` from 0.138.0 to 0.139.0 ([#18](https://github.com/chatwoot/cli/pull/18)).
- Bumped `actions/upload-artifact` from 4 to 7 ([#17](https://github.com/chatwoot/cli/pull/17)).

### Fixed

- Hardened the install script and credential cleanup ([#14](https://github.com/chatwoot/cli/pull/14)).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-13

Adds a raw API escape hatch for cases where the CLI does not yet have a first-class command. There are no breaking changes.

### Added

- **`chatwoot api` raw API command** — make authenticated Chatwoot API requests directly from the CLI ([#13](https://github.com/chatwoot/cli/pull/13)). Account-relative paths such as `/conversations/123` are expanded automatically under `/api/v1/accounts/<account_id>`; use `--exact` to target absolute paths like `/api/v1/profile`. Supports custom methods (`-X`), JSON request bodies, file/stdin bodies (`--data`), and additional headers. JSON responses are pretty-printed; non-JSON responses are passed through as-is.

  ```bash
  chatwoot api /conversations/123
  chatwoot api -X PATCH /conversations/123 --data '{"status":"open"}'
  chatwoot api --exact /api/v1/profile
  ```

### Changed

- Updated the bundled agent skill with stronger raw API guidance: prefer first-class commands, consult the Chatwoot Swagger before raw calls, and treat all writes (including non-GET raw API calls) as privileged actions requiring explicit user confirmation.
- Simplified the README to focus on core setup and usage, delegating full command details to the docs site.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- **`chatwoot conv contact` command** — fetch the contact attached to a conversation directly from the conversation id, without a separate contacts lookup ([#10](https://github.com/chatwoot/cli/pull/10)).
- **Version check** — the CLI now checks for newer releases so users know when an update is available.
- **Smarter install script** — detects an existing install, skips the completion prompt on rerun, and uses the `install` command when available ([#11](https://github.com/chatwoot/cli/pull/11)).

### Changed

- Improved CI and tooling: added `govulncheck`, a `go mod tidy` diff check, a coverage task with a sticky PR coverage comment (gated to same-repo PRs), and dependency review for PRs. Bumped GitHub Actions versions and updated the Go toolchain ([#9](https://github.com/chatwoot/cli/pull/9)).
- Removed the bundled `.claude` directory.
- Bumped `github.com/alecthomas/kong` from 1.14.0 to 1.15.0 ([#4](https://github.com/chatwoot/cli/pull/4)).
- Bumped `github.com/getkin/kin-openapi` from 0.133.0 to 0.138.0 ([#8](https://github.com/chatwoot/cli/pull/8)).
- Bumped `golang.org/x/term` from 0.31.0 to 0.43.0 ([#6](https://github.com/chatwoot/cli/pull/6)).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- **Agent skills** — bundled skill definitions for driving the CLI from agent workflows.
- Pinned GoReleaser for reproducible release builds.

### Fixed

- Avoid caching the user id when authenticating from an environment token.
- Prevent account override from persisting across invocations.
- Redact tokens in verbose logs.
- Sanitize untrusted output fields.
- Validate `smoke.sh` base URL against URL userinfo bypass.
- Pin the zsh completion source to the install path.
- Null-delimit the find loop in the mise agents task.
- Drop the project `bin/` from the mise `PATH`.
- Fixed the docs link, spellcheck errors, the Go version, and skill label usage.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- **`version` command** to report the installed CLI version.
- **`whoami` command**, unified with `me` / `auth status`.
- Better shell completions.
- Better install script.
- CI for tests.

### Fixed

- Clean exit when changing directory.
- Handle output writer errors to satisfy `errcheck`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-08

First release. A CLI for Chatwoot that reads and writes the same Chatwoot API your dashboard uses.

### Added

- List conversations, view details, reply, change status, assign, label, and set priority.
- Noun-grammar CLI with id-first verb dispatch and a custom Kong help printer.
- SDK services for conversations, contacts, inboxes, agents, and profile, including conversation writes and subresources.
- Mentions support in private notes, including team mentions.
- Message rendering with pagination and autofetch.
- API keys stored in the OS keyring; hardened auth input and storage.
- Shell completion support.
- Release pipeline and smoke test.
- Pre-built binaries for macOS, Linux (x86_64 + arm64), and Windows.

Install with `curl -fsSL https://chwt.app/install-cli | sh`, then `chatwoot auth login`.
